        <p>Therefore, the analysis of the BZDs in the beverages and food residues from a suspected drug assisted crime scene has a crucial role for determining of the cause of poisoning and considerable as evidence in the criminal investigations (10, 11).</p>

Selection of flow rate and column temperature Increasing of the column temperature from 25 °C to 50 °C led to a decrease in the total time required for the separation process with decrease of peak broadening and increase in sensitivity. The optimum column temperature was at 45 °C.  Also, increasing the flow rate from 1 mL/min to 1.5 mL/min showed a similar decrease in the retention time. The optimum flow rate was in 1.4 ml/min.). .

Moreover, the stability of benzodiazepines is low in the alkaline media. We observed that the best separation results were achieved at pH.

Detection and quantification limits The determined values of LOD and LOQ for selected BZDs in the proposed method have been showed in Table 4. In this method, LOD for chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, diazepam and midazolam was 0.01µg/mL and for Lorazepam and Flurazpam was 0.02µg/mL. LOQ for chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, diazepam, and midazolam was 0.03 µg/mL and for lorazepam and flurazpam was 0.05 µg/ mL.   ">
